				<h2 id="storySubheader">Welcome to San Bruno High School for the Elementally Advanced once again! <br />It has been a rather exciting couple of weeks...</h2>
				<div id="storycopyWrapper">
				<p>
					Jiro finally was able to challenge his brother, Shinji, to a one-on-one match with the guise that, if he wins, The Rivals, San Bruno's largest, most unruly gange, would have to disband. Shinji accepted the challenge and lost in humiliation, losing all of his friends, including his girlfriend, Mai, in the process.
					Arvid defeated the Beast of Hall 22, Bryan, forcing him to no longer stalk the halls and scare students. Bryan retreated into the shadows, embarresssed. Arvid also teamed up with peer, Ryker, to help protect the halls. Ryken never found proof that HW was responsible for his fathers' fatal accident, but in the meantime, tries to subdue his rage with help of his new, ever-optimistic friend, Arvid.
				</p>
				<p>
					After defeating Shinji, Jiro was challenged by Khai. Jiro would have refused, but Mai pleaded with him in the hopes it would help end her brother's incessant training. Jiro fought with the best of his abilities, but was exhausted and lost. Exhilarated by his win, Khai now desires more challenges and continues training— much to Mai's dismay. Mai, however, has gained affection for Jiro and hopes to call on him again to help her brother's obsessive desire to fight.
				</p>
				<p>
					During this exciting week, a new principal was elected — Principal Frederic Regisworth. Many thought the school would ge come more peaceful. Avrid was even appointed head of all monitors to protect the halls from terrors like Bryan; however, a few weeks after being hired, students began losing their elemental abilities. As various rumors spread, all are now in a state of paranoida and on the defense.
